WinMerge\readme.txt

Source code for the WinMerge program, its plugins, filters, setup program,
and various utilities are all kept in the WinMerge module directory, in 
various subdirectories.

Generally, look for a file "readme.txt" to explain the purpose of a directory,
and a file "Changes.txt" to hold the historical changelog; sometimes the
"Changes.txt" file is located at a higher level -- eg, the WinMerge\Src\Changes.txt
includes all changes to all subdirectories located under WinMerge\Src.

Subdirectories include:

 - Docs
