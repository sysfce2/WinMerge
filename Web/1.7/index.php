<h2>WinMerge 1.7</h2>
<p>WinMerge is the result of my dissatisfaction with existing diff / merge tools available
on the web.&nbsp; They always seemed so lacking, and the one that ships with SourceSafe
doesn't work in standalone mode.&nbsp; So one day, I bit the bullet, grabbed a copy of the
GNU diff code, and wrote a MFC front end for it.&nbsp; Since then, I have added quite a
few features, including SourceSafe integration.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that if you are in search of a directory
synchronizing tool only (ie: Briefcase), WinMerge is probably not the right tool for you.</p>

  <li>Integrated editor</li>
