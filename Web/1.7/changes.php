  unable to load the DLLs.&nbsp; Turns out that specifying /NOENTRY to the 
  linker did the trick.&nbsp; Really all that's needed is new .LANG files, 
  but I added some extra logging to the main app. (Much thanks to <FONT 
  size=3>Cesar de Azevedo Gil for the testing help)</FONT> </LI></UL>

  that location. </LI></UL>
