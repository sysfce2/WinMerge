MakeResDll

This program invokes a resource compiler and a linker to produce 
a language DLL from an RC source file.

It searches the registry to find, in order of preference, 
Visual Studio .NET 2003, Visual Studio .NET, Visual Studio 6,
and Visual Studio 5.

It takes include and library paths for Visual Studio 6 or 5,
but it doesn't pick them up for Visual Studio .NET versions
(if you want to help fix this, please feel free!)


If multiple versions are present, and you wish to override the
normal precedence order, then you must set the following three
keys in this fashion (this example forces use of MSVC6 installed
in the default location):


HKCU\Software\\Thingamahoochie\\MakeResDll\\Settings
 VcBaseFolder = C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MSDev98\Bin
 RCExe = C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MSDev98\Bin\rc.exe
 LinkExe = C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\vc98\bin\link.exe

Or you may force a specific version of MSVC by just setting the value
HKCU\Software\\Thingamahoochie\\MakeResDll\\Settings
 VcVersion = 6

(or 5, or Net, or Net2003)

2003-10-24, Perry:
 The link line is failing for me, using this with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET.
 I can only get this to work with MSVC .NET using the backup method below:
 
 
The backup method to set the lib and include paths, is to use the batch
files that ship with Microsoft Visual Studio. 
 
If these were not set at installation time (it is an option),
these may typically be set by invoking a batch file such as:

 C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat

or

 C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\vcvars32.bat
