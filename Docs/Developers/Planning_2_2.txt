This document shortly describes our plans and goals for
WinMerge 2.2. List of features requested and planned is
in end of this document. Discussion about this plan and
anything related to WinMerge and WinMerge development
happens in SourceForge Developers-forum:
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=41639

2.1 so far
==========
- Lots of new features
  * Unicode support
  * Shell integration
  * Plugins
  * Patch generating
  * Lots of UI and usability improvements (new icons most visible ones)
  * Resizable open-dialog
  * Lots of improvements to file compare
    - rewritten undo (I personally haven't seen it fail for a long
      time)
    - ignore blank lines fixed
    - line- & column -numbers, line length in statusbar
    - diff pane (lots of users like this!)
    - excellent EOL handling, with simple mode for normal users
    - hilighting differences in lines inside diff
    - merging current diff and moving to next makes merging
      remarkably faster (excellent idea contributed as RFE)
  * Lots of improvements to directory compare
    - skipped files have own category in dir compare
    - dir compare has customisable fields
    - threading backend work done
    - Statusbar
    - Stopping long compare
    - Folder browsing in non-recursive compare

  
2.1.2.0
-------
- Unexpected amount of downloads > 5000 - no beta before got so much
- Already contains many new features users like
- Bugs in 2.1.2.0 caused lot of interest in experimentals before
  2.1.4.0?
- Still most of bug reports are from active developers
- Lots of RFEs, some very good ideas

2.1.4.0
-------
- Took long time, but worth it
- Unicode support & plugins
- One visible bug (RC-plugin run automatically) 
- Usability improvements
- Most bugs in 2.1.2.0 fixed
- Seems to be stable, so branched to make another release to 
  fix some problems for users wanting to use 2.1 seriously
- Good version for "preview" of 2.2
  
2.1.6.0
-------
- Lot of new features
- Usability improved from 2.1.4
- Mostly UI work left to do
- No bad bugs reported yet (in 3 weeks)


2.1 Development
===============

Timetable for 2.2 release
-------------------------
- We don't want to freeze and publish exact date for final release
- But we want to freeze date for first 2.2RC
- We must publish 2.2 translation freeze
- Translation freeze ~couple of months before final release,
  ~ one month before first 2.2RC
** 2.2RC in end of May 2004
** 2.2 translation freeze end of April 2004
** "Soft" feature freeze end of April 2004
- One or two RC releases expected, hopefully one is enough
- We can have shorter feature freeze than for 2.0 because current
  codebase is a lot better debugged and documented, no risk for
  critical last-minute bugs like in 2.0
- Feature freeze is not absolute, some smaller features can be added,
  but there must not be changes to translations!
- Timetable is reasonably tight. But 2.1 is already in shape we could
  start feature freeze. There are some very interesting features
  in development, we want those for 2.2.
- If some feature misses 2.2 train, we propably could do 2.4 (or
  whatever) a lot faster than 2.2. So we won't try to push new
  features for 2.1 in hurry. Also, current stability of 2.1 must not
  be threatened!


Adding new features to 2.1
--------------------------
- Adding feature needs approval from person responsible about planning
- Features should have review from other developer
- If developer in question knows code well, there is no need for review
  E.g. developer who added unicode support does not need reviews for
  unicode enchangements.
- UI changes need more consideration than others, preferably review
  from developer familiar with UI design.
- Every feature needs one responsible developer. Responsible developer
  must be reacting to possible regressions and bugs after applying
  patch
- Contributed patch always needs one responsible developer driving
  patch into CVS.
  

Bug fixes for 2.1
-----------------
- Simple bug fixes or fixes to code developer in question knows well
  (local, affecting one function or couple of) can be
  applied without submitting to SourceForge.
- If developer cannot quarantee fix is right, it must be submitted
  to SourceForge
- More complex fixes or fixes affecting internal interfaces or UI
  must always be submitted to SourceForge

Translations
------------
- We'll announce translation freeze for translators and in development
  forums and lists.
- That will be signal for translators to start updating to 2.2
- We'll need one beta release for translators to get sources and
  test their translations
- That beta is not yet RC!

User Documentation
==================
- Kimmo wants to do from scratch, using parts of existing documentation
- Help welcome
- First draft available
- DocBook/XML - needed utilities are freely available
- Easy to convert to several formats, including HTML & PDF
- What about translations? Currently we have only English
  documentation, are translators interested in translating
  documentation?
- Provide HTML and PDF within install package?


Features requested and considered for 2.2
=========================================
If you want to implement any of these items, please add note to
mentioned RFE item. If there is no item already, create one.
We try to keep this list up-to-date too for tracking status.
SourceForge Developers -forum is place for discussion about
these items. SourceForge RFE list:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13216&atid=363216
SourceForge Developers-forum:
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=41639

1) Multi-doc enabled directory and file compares
   - Important usability improvement
   - Requires (9) to be done first (which is done now)
   - Mostly UI work?
   - Nobody working with this at the moment
   - Not must for 2.2, but if time allows this is nice to have

2) Archive file support
   - This is killer feature!
   - Jochen is doing great work with this
   - We want this for 2.2, other developers ready to help Jochen
   - Jochen submitted patch 2003-12-11
   - Merge7z project applied to CVS 2004-01-07
     integration completed 2004-01-19
   *** DONE ***
   
3) Directory compare reports
   - RFE #669461 Save directory compare report
   - First take with Ctrl-C copying view contents done
   - Contributor working (?) with this
   - Seems however won't happen for 2.2

4) On-demand-rescan for directory compare
   - Requires mostly some reorg in dir compare code
   - Allows many other usability improvements
   - Also some long-standing bugs can be fixed after this
   - Nobody working with this at the moment,
     Kimmo at least interested, but cannot say if time permits
   - Time is short for 2.2 inclusion! This is risky!

5) wxWindows port
   - RFE #851438 wxWindows port
   - Hard to say anything about work amount
   - Cross-platform WinMerge would be great boost for users
   - More developer interest too
   - Nobody working with this at the moment
   - Needs dedicated people to take care of all issues around this,
     not just porting code, but keeping builds working etc.
   - Not for 2.2

6) Project files
   - RFE #785415 Project Files
   - Would be important usability improvement for many users
   - Requires (9) to be done first (which is done now)
   - Not big code changes, mostly setting and filename
     saving and loading from project file
   - Nobody working with this at the moment
   - UI?
   - Time is short for 2.2 inclusion!

7) Show only different lines
   - RFE #709415 Display only different lines
   - The most requested feature lately
   - Requires mostly editor code changes - not clear we want to
     do those (because of 13)
   - Not very important, usability improvement not clear
   - Nobody working with this at the moment
   - Not for 2.2

8) Code-page support
   - RFE #837530 select codepage for file
   - For compare/merge program, this is one of real issues left
   - Some backend code already applied to CVS, status not known
   - UI implementation needs some planning (where we want to show
     current code-page, where it should be changed?)
   - Perry has done backend code, interested in UI part too?
   - Needed for 2.2 to say WinMerge is now full-scale solution for
     file compare/merge
   - Note: listing available codepages is a problem; Perry thinking
     about optionally using iconv

9) Options (UI) rewrite
   - UI for usability, backend for needed features
   - 2 directions: Options-server-class or dividing settings for
     different classes
   - Options-server class for other features
   - Done by Kimmo
   - Needed for 2.2 (other features need this)
   *** DONE ***

10) (S)FTP support
   - RFE #809010 FTP and SFTP support
   - UI and backend code changes needed unknown
   - Contributor working with this?
   - Status unknown
   - Time is short for 2.2 inclusion!

11) 3-way merge
   - RFE #839815 Diff3, one output
   - Lot of changes to UI code - most of current code assumes
     we have two files: left and right
   - Requires (12)
   - What about directory compare?
   - Nobody working with this at the moment
   - Not for 2.2. Too risky. A lot of code assumes 2 files.

12) Diffutils upgrade
   - No UI changes
   - CVS reorg makes easier
   - Nobody working with this at the moment
   - Kimmo wants to do at least some work with this,
     Perry offered to help
   - Not for 2.2. Too risky merging.

13) Editor component update/change
   - Some discussions, but we don't know even if we want to upgrade
     to TextCenter or change to totally different component
   - Upgrading to TextcCenter brings more features, and some fixes to
     editor code.
   - But we lose many improvements and fixes done ourselves!
   - Nobody working with this at the moment
   - Not for 2.2. Too risky.
   
14) .cvsignore based filtering
   - RFE #787447 .cvsignore-based file filter
   - Interesting idea! Surely useful for CVS users
   - UI changes are one option?
   - Backend changes? Perry submitted idea for this to RFE #787447.
   - Nobody working with this at the moment. Laoran interested
   - Considered for 2.2 if somebody wants to implement this
 
15) Graphically resolve CVS conflicts
   - RFE #436548 Allow WinMerge to merged CVS conflicts.
   - Useful for CVS users, not many programs do this, so would be
     good help for many users.
   - UI changes not clear? Adding "Open conflict file" to menu?
   - Backend changes? Some code suggested in RFE from TortoiseCVS?
   - Nobody working with this at the moment
   - Considered for 2.2 if somebody wants to implement this

16) Browse folders in non-recursive directory compare
   - RFE #469884 Browse folders in non-recursive directory compare
   - Usability improvement!
   - Done by Kimmo
   - For 2.2
   - How does this work with archive patch? - Works nice :)
   - Patch applied to CVS 2004-01-07
   *** DONE ***

17) Filter UI
   - RFE #531863 Better filter selection UI
   - Filters need to have decent UI for users to start using them
     efficiently
   - Mostly UI work
   - Kimmo already done some work for this, Laoran interested too
   - For 2.2
   
18) Apply patches
   - RFE #695741 Generate and apply patches
   - Common development task, nice combination with patch creating
   - Work needed not clear, some UI changes, lot of work anyhow
   - Needs integrating GNU/patch to WinMerge
   - Nobody working with this at the moment
   - Kimmo interested in doing this, propably no time though
   - Not for 2.2

19) Copy Folder in dir compare
   - RFE #764481 Copy Folder
   - Only important functionality missing for file/dir management
   - Usability!
   - Done by Kimmo
   - Easy with CShellFileOp wrapper class
   - For 2.2
   - Patch applied 2004-02-26
   *** DONE ***

20) Do not show again for messageboxes
   - RFE #809131 Add "Do not show again" option for messageboxes
   - Usability!
   - Mostly UI changes, new page for options to reset dialogs
   - Nobody working with this at the moment, Laoran wants to
   *** DONE ***

21) One-key diff navigation and merge
   - RFE #837803 Make Alt key optional
   - Usability!
   - Kimmo submitted patch (#892023 Alternative (no alt-key) merge mode).
     That patch has several problems, needs rethinking. Help welcome!
   - Kimmo's simpler patch #938609 applied 2004-04-21
   *** DONE ***

22) Dir compare statusbar to auto-hide
   - RFE #838982 Skip "Press any key" every time I compare
   - Usability
   - Needs (23)?
   - UI change, add checkbox "Hide automatically"?
   - Kimmo submitted patch (#913073 Option to automatically close
     compare pane).
   - Patch applied 2004-03-10
   *** DONE ***

23) Dir compare statusbar to be shown from menu
   - Currently no way to show after closed
   - Statusbar is good "quickview" for status, how many different files
     etc.
   - Must be "live" i.e. if files are merged, contents updated
   - UI and some backend work (updating filecounts)
   - Kimmo submitted patch (#913073 Option to automatically close
     compare pane) for opening pane from menu
   - Patch applied 2004-03-10
   - Live update NOT done
   - Considered for 2.2 if somebody wants to implement this

24) Number of diffs in directory compare
   - RFE #848792 Display number of differences in directory view
   - Nice-to-have, not essential functionality
   - Needs some UI and backend work
   - For 2.2
   - PATCH: [ 878631 ] Add generic named properties to DiffContext
   - Perry applied patch 2004-01-21
   *** DONE ***

25) Put deleted files to Recycle Bin
   - RFE #871937 Optionally put deleted files to Recyle Bin
   - Protects user files, many are expecting this, because
     Windows by default puts deleted files to Recycle bin
   - Done by Kimmo
   - For 2.2
   - Patch applied 2004-02-27
   *** DONE ***

26) Allow user to restore default options
   - RFE #872959 Reset for directory compare column settings
   - User may got lost after trying different settings, so easy
     "backup" is needed.
   - At least for dirview (column) settings and compare settings (color too?)
   - Compare options must default to strict set so that no differences
     are ignored
   - Kimmo submitted and applied patches for options and dirview columns
   *** DONE ***
