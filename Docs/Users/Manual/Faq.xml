        <question>
          <para>Why are there two executable files,
          <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> and
          <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename>?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> is an ANSI (8-bit) executable which
              works in all 32-bit Windows systems. It does not have Unicode
              support.</para>

              <para>Internally, it stores only ANSI characters (256
              possibilities). If you open a Unicode file, the characters 
              must be converted to the ANSI codepage. As there are
              over 100,000 Unicode characters, and only 256 can be
              represented in the ANSI codepage, data loss may
              occur. Conversion may be approximative (accents are
              lost), or impossible (characters appear as "?").</para>

              <para><filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> also can not open files
              with names outside the current ANSI codepag (e.g., WinMerge.exe
              can not open a file with a Hebrew name, if run on an English
              system. WinMergeU.exe can open such files.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename> is a Unicode enabled
              executable which works on Windows NT4, Windows 2000, and newer
              systems.</para>

        <answer>
          <para>Are you trying to select a directory by clicking on it in the
          upper part of the Open File dialog ? The Open File dialog will then

        <question>
          <para>Does WinMerge support merging three files? Sometimes it is
          called 3-way merge, where one file is ancestor. This would be useful
          for version control!</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Unfortunately not. We acknowledge it would be good feature but
          have no plans to implement it in near future. This can be somewhat
          worked around by using two WinMerge instances.</para>

          <para>Not currently. If somebody wants to help/work with
          cross-platform support (using <ulink

          <para>There is no CVS integration?!</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Which kind of CVS integration WinMerge should have? Adding CVS
          client features to WinMerge is questionable since there are many
          good CVS clients already. Conflict file resolution is a feature we are
          planning to add in future releases.</para>

        <answer>
          <para>MRU is the abbreviation for "Most Recently Used", and means

        <question>
          <para>Why do large files sometimes show as different in the
          directory view, but come up as identical in the merge editor?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This is because large files use the "<guilabel>Quick
          Compare</guilabel>" method, even when the [<menuchoice>
              <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>

              <guimenuitem>Options /</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice> <guilabel>Compare</guilabel> / <guilabel>File
          Compare Method</guilabel>] setting is set to "<guilabel>Full
          Compare</guilabel>". This is a speed optimization. To test if this
          is causing the behavior you're seeing, you could raise the limit for
          the <guilabel>Quick Compare</guilabel> threshold for large files. It
          is stored in the registry as:</para>

    <title>Questions about binary files</title>

      <qandaentry>
        <question>
          <para>WinMerge says "<guilabel>Binary files are
          different</guilabel>", but I am not comparing binary files?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>If you are using <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> (not
          <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename>), then your files may be Unicode
          files. <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> cannot handle Unicode
          files. Please try comparing files with
          <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename> if you have Windows NT4, Windows
          2000 or newer Windows version.</para>

          <para>WinMerge cannot compare registry files
          (<filename><replaceable>*</replaceable>.reg</filename>)?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Windows registry files
          (<filename><replaceable>*</replaceable>.reg</filename>) are Unicode
          files (UTF-16 or UCS-2) -- see previous answer.</para>

        <question>
          <para>WinMerge tells my files are binary files even when they are
          not?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>There is one or more zero-bytes in your file(s). If WinMerge
          finds zero-bytes from files, it considers the files to be binary files. You
          can try to remove those zero-bytes from files. Alternatively, you may open 
          the files with the DisplayBinaryFiles plugin. This plugin allows viewing 
          binary files, but not editing them.</para>

        <question>
          <para>I cannot merge binary files?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>WinMerge does not include binary file viewer/editor so
          WinMerge can only show if binary files are identical or
          different.</para>

        <question>
          <para>I would like to see the line numbers?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>WinMerge shows current line in editor statusbar. WinMerge
          cannot show in-editor linenumbers. That is one feature we might
          consider for future releases.</para>

        <question>
          <para>I see question marks instead of letters in files?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This is what we call a "lossy" conversion.</para>

          <para>For Unicode files (UCS-2, UTF-8), use
          <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename>.</para>

          <para>For ANSI files, this is probably due to code-page problems. If
          "<guilabel>Use codepage info</guilabel>" is selected from
          <guimenuitem>Options</guimenuitem>, turn that off and see if it
          helps.</para>

        <question>
          <para>I cannot select proportional fonts for editor?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Unfortunately WinMerge supports only
          non-proportional fonts.</para>

        <question>
          <para>What is delaying of (automatic) rescan? Why it is
          needed?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>When <guilabel>Automatic Rescan</guilabel> is enabled, WinMerge
          delays rescanning while user edits files. So there is no rescanning
          happening when user types text but shortly after user has finished
          typing. Without this delaying WinMerge would do rescan after every
          typed letter and editing files would become slow. This delaying
          especially improves editing of bigger files which can take several
          seconds to rescan.</para>

        <answer>
          <para>No, you can't. Many users have requested this feature but we
          don't have any plans to implement it. We don't believe it would
          really improve usability.</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>"Perry-style" patches are zip-files containing original and
          changed files in different directories. WinMerge has internal
          support (surprise?) for handling these files. Just select zip file

        <answer>
          <para>No. It may be added in later versions but until then Win32
          port of diffutils can be used. The Win32 port of diffutils (and patch)
          can be downloaded from <productname>GnuWin32</productname> project
          from SourceForge: <ulink

        <answer>
          <para>No. The patch tool from GnuWin32 project can be used for patch
          applying since WinMerge produces GNU/diffutils compatible patch
          files. See above question.</para>
