        <question>
          <para>Why are there two executable files,
          <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> and
          <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename>?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> is an ANSI (8-bit)
              executable which works in all 32-bit Windows systems. It does
              not have Unicode support.</para>

              <para>Internally, it stores only ANSI characters (256
              possibilities). If you open a Unicode file, the characters must
              be converted to the ANSI codepage. As there are over 100,000
              Unicode characters, and only 256 can be represented in the ANSI
              codepage, data loss may occur. Conversion may be approximative
              (accents are lost), or impossible (characters appear as
              "?").</para>

              <para><filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> also can not open files
              with names outside the current ANSI codepage (e.g., WinMerge.exe
              can not open a file with a Hebrew name, if run on an English
              system. WinMergeU.exe can open such files.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename> is a Unicode enabled
              executable which works on Windows NT4, Windows 2000, and newer
              systems.</para>

          <para>When wanting to compare folders, I cannot select a folder in
          Browse-dialog?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Browse to the folder you want to compare (folder contents is
          shown in the dialog). Do not select any of the files or subfolders,
          just select the <guibutton>Open</guibutton>-button when
          "<guilabel>Folder Selection</guilabel>" is shown in filename
          editbox. If you already selected any of the files or subfolders,
          just write some nonsense to the filename editbox and select the
          Open-button. When the filename editbox doesn't contain any existing
          filename then WinMerge opens the folder.</para>

        <question>
          <para>Does WinMerge support merging three files? Sometimes it is
          called 3-way merge, where one file is ancestor. This would be useful
          for version control!</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Unfortunately not. We acknowledge it would be good feature but
          have no plans to implement it in near future. This can be somewhat
          worked around by using two WinMerge instances. Or using third path
          parameter given from command line. See <link
          linkend="CommandLine">Command Line</link> -chapter for more
          information.</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Which kind of CVS integration WinMerge should have? Adding CVS
          client features to WinMerge is questionable since there are many
          good CVS clients already. WinMerge can resolve conflict files, see

        <question>
          <para>Why do large files sometimes show as different in the folder
          view, but come up as identical in the merge editor?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This is because WinMerge uses the "<guilabel>Quick
          Compare</guilabel>" method for large files always. It allows
          WinMerge to compare large files more efficiently. To test if this is
          causing the behavior you're seeing, you could raise the limit for
          the <guilabel>Quick Compare</guilabel> threshold for large files. It
          is stored in the registry as:</para>

          <screen>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Thingamahoochie\WinMerge\Settings\QuickMethodLimit</screen>

          <para>You may consider raising this limit if you constantly compare
          large text files. Be careful to not raise it too much "for just to
          be sure". 100 MB is too much.</para>

          <para>The default value for the limit is 4MB (0x400000).</para>

        <answer>
          <para>Mentioned files are plugins written with Visual Basic (6.0).
          WinMerge installer does not contain Visual Basic runtime files so
          those plugins cannot be loaded. You can:</para>

          <para>Maybe your files have different line-ending styles (e.g.

        <question>
          <para>What is delaying of (automatic) rescan? Why it is
          needed?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>When <guilabel>Automatic Rescan</guilabel> is enabled,
          WinMerge delays rescanning while user edits files. So there is no
          rescanning happening when user types text but shortly after user has
          finished typing. Without this delaying WinMerge would do rescan
          after every typed letter and editing files would become slow. This
          delaying especially improves editing of bigger files which can take
          several seconds to rescan.</para>

          <para>"Perry-style" patches are zip-files containing original and

          support (surprise?) for handling these files. Just select zip file

          <para>No. It may be added in later versions but until then Win32
          port of diffutils can be used. The Win32 port of diffutils (and
          patch) can be downloaded from <application>GnuWin32</application>

          <para>No. The patch tool from GnuWin32 project can be used for patch
          applying since WinMerge produces GNU/diffutils compatible patch
          files. See above question.</para>
